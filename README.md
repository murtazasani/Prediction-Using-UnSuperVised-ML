# Project Title: Prediction-Using-UnSuperVised-ML
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>Clustering
In this project, we have implemented the K-Means Clustering Algorithm to cluster the data based on iris dataset. The dataset used for this project contains information about various features like sepal length (cm),	sepal width (cm),	petal length (cm) etc. that can be used for iris data clustering. The K-Means algorithm will allow us to Cluster the objects of Same types in the same Category.
